Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

Title:
Horiseon Acessibility  


Description
This project is being used to make the html code and css understandable ans accessable to all.

Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.


Usage

Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
